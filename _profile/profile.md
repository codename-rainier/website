Entrepreneur at heart.  From landing a 2 year project with Pilipinas Shell Petroleum after graduating from college in my 20's to becoming a real estate investor at age 44, I am dedicated to finding the ultimate passive income stream. The road to achieving my life long dream of acquiring such assets was full of challenges and is not without failures.  But just as failures are to success, I was obligated by my mentors to pursue a career as a corporate employee. I am proficient in Sales with 22 years of corporate and entrepreneurial experience. My area of expertise allowed me to consistently hit sales targets and achieve over +150% sales revenue from a -240% downed territory performance year over year. I cherrish my experience in Sales dearly to this day. 

Due to my curiousity of how life would be like when I retire, I jumped the gun and resigned from corporate life at age 33 and went back to school to learn Automotive repair and gas welding.  I have been a certified mechanic since.  During my years being a mechanic, I endulged in 3D printing, design and embedded software programming. I ended up helping students from Architecture and Engineering to further develop and modify their thesis projects.

After living through the 2 year erratic lockdowns during the Covid-19 pandemic, I realized that I had the inclination to continue my software programming skills to push it further into being a full fledged software engineer.  

I then present to you the highlights of my curriculum vitae.  Feel free to contact me directly via email if you have any inquiries.
