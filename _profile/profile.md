From landing a 2 year project with Pilipinas Shell Petroleum after graduating from college in my 20's to becoming a real estate investor at age 44, I am dedicated to continuously improving myself.  But just as failures are to success, I was obligated by my mentors to pursue a career as a corporate employee. I am proficient in Sales with 22 years of corporate and entrepreneurial experience. My area of expertise allowed me to consistently hit sales targets and achieve over +120% sales revenue year over year.

I pursued being a certified mechanic at the age of 33 and continued on to learning more about embedded software programming 3 years later.  After living through the 2 year erratic lockdowns during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, I pushed further into being a full fledged software engineer in 2022.  

I then present to you the highlights of my curriculum vitae.  Feel free to contact me directly via email if you have any inquiries.
