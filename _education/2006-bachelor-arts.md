Electrical & Electronics Engineering was what I really wanted to pursue in college. But somehow it ended up being my second choice after my double major degree.  I was advised by the administration office to just shift when I got to third year but decided not to as I always do my best to finish what I've started. Thank you DLSU! I am now enjoying the best of both worlds *(ADMU vs DLSU). This is why I don't go to UAAP games!*
