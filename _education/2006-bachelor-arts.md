Electrical & Computer Engineering was what I really wanted to pursue in college. But somehow it ended up being my second choice after deciding to be a double major degree holder.  I was advised by the DLSU administration office to just shift when I got to third year but later on decided not to as I have a habit of doing my best to finish what I've started. Thank you DLSU! I am now enjoying the best of both worlds *(ADMU & DLSU). This is why I don't go to UAAP games!*
