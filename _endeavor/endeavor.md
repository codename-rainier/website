*The <a href="https://psa.gov.ph/content/functional-literacy-rate-estimated-916-percent-2019" target="_blank">illiteracy rate in the Phillipines</a> was 8.4% in 1999 and is still increasing. This is roughly 6.7million people who cannot read nor write. If we remain apathetic towards this growing concern, how will our fellow countrymen find hope of a better future? This is my way of taking a stand.*
