As television is to radio, BTG aims to cover more ground that KJK alone cannot cover. Our ways of receiving information has evolved in many ways. And one of the evolutions of information delivery systems are podcasts. BTG discusses the same topics discussed in KJK but with more expressions and time devoted to the explanation of the life lessons.  Podcasts allow a more effortless way to receive such information and we are exploring this avenue as well. Hopefully, we reach someone out there that is willing to capitalize on themselves enough so that they can be encouraged to keep pursuing their dreams. Even if it is just one person helped makes it all worth while.
