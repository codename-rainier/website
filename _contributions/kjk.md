KJK was created to serve as a listener, narrator and video source illustrator to further the concepts and teachings that are discussed in the videos. Oftentimes, the target audience's response to the advices discussed within the videos is to simply move away from the topic in real life circumstances. This is mostly due to reasons pertaining to the "lack of financial support" as to why early types of education was discontinued. Somehow, the stereotype of this nature is loosely used for purposes of discontinuing formal education or finding menial work at a young age. This then leads to the increase of the illiteracy rates of the country. To help curb the further degredation of our literacy rate, the lessons and teachings acquired from a formal education and/or proper work experience are delivered in smaller pieces to avoid information overload for the targetted audience. These nuggets of information are then made more appealing to encourage the audience to continue pursuing their much needed education from elementary and high school. In the process, they are encouraged to continue their initial efforts after they are made to realize that "financial aid" should not be the root cause for discontinuing formal education. The more mature nature of some of the videos also discuss higher levels of financial knowledge in order to achieve greater goals towards financial independence. These are done to further illustrate the topics discussed in the podcast version of KJK, BRIDGING THE GAP.
