WHEN THE GOING GETS TOUGH, THE TOUGH GETS GOING  
YOU ARE YOUR BEST ASSET. CAPITALIZE AND CONTINUE TO DEVELOP YOURSELF
USE A PROBLEM AS IF IT WAS A MORAL COMPASS  
ALWAYS DO YOUR BEST. DON'T JUST TRY  
GROW LIKE A TREE  
A DIFFERENT OUTCOME REQUIRES A DIFFERENT PROCESS
KEEP AN OPEN MIND  
THERE WILL ALWAYS BE A BIGGER FISH. LET IT GO
DEFINITELY BUFFET OVER A FANCY DINER  
DON'T SKIMP ON FOOD  
NASA DIYOS ANG AWA, NASA TAO ANG GAWA  
UGALI SA ISA, UGALI SA LAHAT  
BUMABA KA SA BUNDOK *(Song)*
