WHEN THE GOING GETS TOUGH, THE TOUGH GETS GOING  

USE A PROBLEM AS IF IT WAS A MORAL COMPASS  

ALWAYS DO YOUR BEST  

GROW LIKE A TREE  

KEEP AN OPEN MIND

DEFINITELY BUFFET OVER A FANCY DINER  

DON'T SKIMP ON FOOD  

NASA DIYOS ANG AWA, NASA TAO ANG GAWA  

UGALI SA ISA, UGALI SA LAHAT  

BUMABA KA SA BUNDOK
